# BasicPortfolio

## Overview

This is an early version of my web design portfolio. I've used only html and CSS to build these pages per the skills taught to me at the UT Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of the activity was to build a page from scratch without using Bootstrap or any other front-end framework.
